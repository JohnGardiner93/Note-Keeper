## Description:  
This app was created in order to practice MVC architecture. The result is a fully-functioning note-taking app that allows users to take and save notes to their browser. It is done completely with Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. It is entirely front-end. This app uses the user's browser's localStorage to store notes from previous sessions.

## Use Cases:  
User can enter text into a text area to take a note. The note can then be saved. It will be displayed below the input are alongside other notes. Notes will be shown in a uniform manner. Notes can be seen with more detail (via button or clicking the element). A modal window will then show the note in full detail. Notes can also be deleted.
